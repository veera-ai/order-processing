# Git Commit Guide for Order Processing Mock API Implementation

This document provides the Git commit message and commands for committing the changes made to the Order Processing Mock API implementation.

## Commit Message

```
feat: Implement Order Processing Mock API

This commit adds a complete Express.js-based mock API for the Order Processing Component with the following features:

- RESTful API endpoints for Order Management (CRUD operations)
- Checkout process endpoints (initialize, process, shipping cost, tax)
- Payment processing endpoints (process, retrieve, refund)
- Swagger API documentation with OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- JWT authentication middleware
- Error handling and validation middleware
- Mock data generation utilities
- File-based database implementation

The mock API mirrors the endpoints defined in the Java Spring Boot implementation
and provides a way to test the API contract before the main service is fully implemented.
```

## Git Commands for Committing Changes

Follow these steps to commit the changes to the repository:

### 1. Check Repository Status

First, check the status of your local repository to see which files have been modified:

```bash
cd /home/kavia/workspace/order-processing
git status
```

### 2. Stage Changes

Stage all the changes in the mock-api directory:

```bash
# Stage all changes in the mock-api directory
git add mock-api/
```

### 3. Commit Changes

Commit your staged changes with the descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: Implement Order Processing Mock API

   - CORS support
   - JSON request parsing
   - Request logging with Morgan
   - JWT authentication

2. **API Routes**:
   - Order management endpoints
   - Checkout process endpoints
   - Payment processing endpoints

3. **Swagger Documentation**:
   - OpenAPI 3.0 specification
   - Interactive API documentation UI
   - Detailed request/response schemas

4. **Data Models**:
   - Order model
   - Checkout model
   - Payment model
   - Address and OrderItem schemas

5. **Middleware**:
   - Authentication middleware
   - Validation middleware
   - Error handling middleware
